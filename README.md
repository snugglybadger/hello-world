# hello-world

Hey Everyone,

My name is TJ. This is my first attempt at using GitHub. I'm a college student that's looking to learn Web Development for career options down the road. My hobbies include producing music with ableton live, playing video games, and browsing the web. I'd like to own an apartment in Manhattan one day, and I've always wanted to travel to Europe. First thing's first though, I have to get a real job.

Signing off,

TJ
